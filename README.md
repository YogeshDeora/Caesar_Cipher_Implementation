# Caesar_Cipher_Implementation
A simple Java program to encrypt and decrypt text using the Caesar Cipher algorithm.

📌 Features
User inputs a message and shift value.
Encrypts the message using Caesar Cipher.
Decrypts the encrypted message back to the original.
Supports both uppercase and lowercase letters.
Non-alphabetic characters remain unchanged.

🖥️ How it works
The program takes a message from the user.
A shift value is provided (e.g., 3).
Each letter is shifted by the given value in the alphabet.
Decryption is done by shifting letters back.

🚀 Technologies Used
Java
Scanner for user input
StringBuilder for string manipulation
